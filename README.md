conveyor_poe_4 has the version where it does its first try, has to wait to reconnect, and then does the alignment after. Maybe just altering the watchdog will help with this. This version is functional.

conveyor_poe_5 is experimental and tries to do all of it, but it has its own issues and doesn't work.
